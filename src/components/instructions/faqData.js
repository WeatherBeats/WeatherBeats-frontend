    question: 'The ‘Next Playlist button is not showing up.',
    response: 'This could mean one of two things. \n\nIf you navigated away from the page and came back, we ask that you Check Weather Again to get the freshest weather results for your area. \n\nOr this could simply mean that the selected weather and/or genre is very specific and there are currently very few playlists on Spotify.'
